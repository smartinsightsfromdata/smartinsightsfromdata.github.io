            <p>I strive to make my clients more competitive and forward looking, with a better understanding of the present and the future of their business. <br()>
            With over 20 years experience in the field of data, analytics, advanced visualization and GIS I use my expertise and enthusiasm to implement leading-edge solutions. <br()>
            bWhile I have a lot of experience in "traditional", pay-for tools and methodologies I am a champion of Open Source and Open Data to come up to cost-effective solution for new and old problems.

            <br()> I love to work on projects with a strong component of advanced visualization using the most advanced libaries available.

<br()> When I'm not mining data or building a new library you might find me cooking a mean pasta for my three hungry teens, skippering the seas or walking our boisterous sheepdog. <a href="http://martoglio.com"></a>.</p>
