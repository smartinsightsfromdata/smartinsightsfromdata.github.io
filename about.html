            <br>My aim is to make my clients more competitive and more forward looking, with a better understanding of the present and future of their business. <br>
            With over 20 years experience in the field of data, analytics, SQL / NoSQL technologies and GIS I use my expertise and enthusiasm to implement leading-edge solutions. <br>  
            While I have a lot of experience in "traditional", pay-for tools and methodologies, I'm a champion of Open Source and Open Data to come up with cost-effective solutions for new and old problems.

            <br> I love to work on projects with a strong component of advanced visualization using the latest libraries available.

<br> And when I'm not mining data or building a new library, you might find me cooking a mean pasta for my three hungry teens, skippering the seas or walking our boisterous sheepdog Sasha. <a href="http://martoglio.com"></a>.</p>
